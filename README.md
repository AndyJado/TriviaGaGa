Developer won't collects, publish, or share with any third party any data from this App.

*All the data I (as one and only developer and maintainer) have access to is shown below:*
- I get to see your channel string.
- I'm able to see the picture you send to the channel if I intentionnaly hit download which I won't do in the production environment.
- I can delete the whole record which is equivalent the in-app behavior where you swipe a card off.
- I will delete all records or none at my will in purpose of cleanning the database.
- **It's user's responsibility to seperate his/her channel with others.**

*The license says non primarily commercial intended use, well, the best metaphor I found for my app was "blowing a dandelion", I finished my app, I used my app, the metaphor came to me, i started google 'dandelion' and I found this picture which just draw my mind, namely, even if I draw something myself, the idea was stolen from this picture, so, would it be a fair use if I give up all the direct profit made by the icon? ( like a printed T-shirt or some kind)*
