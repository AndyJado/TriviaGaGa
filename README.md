The image for the icon comes below, which is under Creative Commons 4.0 BY-NC License:
https://www.pngall.com/dandelion-png/download/61121

*The license says non primarily commercial intended use, well, the best metaphor I found for my app was "blowing a dandelion", I finished my app, I used my app, the metaphor came to me, i started google 'dandelion' and I found this picture which just draw my mind, namely, even if I draw something myself, the idea was stolen from this picture, so, would it be a fair use if I give up all the direct profit made by the icon? ( like a printed T-shirt or sth)
