## 隐私政策 (Privacy Policy)

开发者不会从此 App 中收集任何数据。

Developer collects no data from App.

*All the data I could get is shown below, I get to see your channel string, download the picture you captured in app, and delete the whole record ( but only before your LOVEDONE swipe it off). But like the policy said, I collect none of them.*

I plan to clean the container (delete all records) every week.

## Code & Asset reference

Thank you captain Nick.

- The image for the icon comes below, which is under Creative Commons 4.0 BY-NC License:

*The license says non primarily commercial intended use, well, the best metaphor I found for my app was "blowing a dandelion", I finished my app, I used my app, the metaphor came to me, i started google 'dandelion' and I found this picture which just draw my mind, namely, even if I draw something myself, the idea was stolen from this picture, so, would it be a fair use if I give up all the direct profit made by the icon? ( like a printed T-shirt or some kind)*
